            <h2>Submissions</h2>
            <p>Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe <strong>original</strong> work <strong>not previously published</strong> and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. <strong>Abstract submission is a prerequisite for full paper submission.</strong> We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two formats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 10 pages</li>
                <li><strong>Short Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 6 pages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both types of submission must be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference proceedings format</a> (two-columns, single-space, 10pt) and <strong>must include references and acknowledgments within the page limit.</strong> Submitted papers are subject to single-blind reviews.</p>
            <p>In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version. Conference content will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/">DBLP</a>.</p>
            <p>By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will register at full registration rate to the conference and present the paper in person.</p>            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
