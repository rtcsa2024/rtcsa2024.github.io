            <h3>Abstract:</h3>
            <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of computer systems and architecture, processing units stand at the heart of technological innovation. This keynote address, "The Future of Processing Units: From CPU to GPU and Beyond," embarks on a comprehensive journey through the past, present, and future of processing technologies. We will begin by exploring the historical evolution and foundational role of Central Processing Units (CPUs) in driving computational capabilities and system development. Following this, we explore into the rise of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), highlighting their transformative and broad impact on parallel processing and AI applications.

                As we navigate the current state of processing units, we will inspect cutting-edge developments and innovations that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computing. This includes an overview of emerging technologies such as NPU(neural processing units) and other specialized accelerators that are redefining performance and efficiency metrics. Additionally, the session will cover emerging paradigms like Processing-In-Memory (PIM) and in-storage computing, which are revolutionizing data processing by bringing computation closer to data, thereby improving performance and energy efficiency.
                
                Looking ahead, we will envision the future of processing units, discussing the potential breakthroughs and challenges that lie on the horizon. Topics will include advancements in quantum computing and quantum processing units (QPU). Attendees will gain insights into how these evolving technologies will shape the future of computing, impacting industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and beyond. Join us for an insightful session that not only celebrates the milestones of processing units but also inspires innovative thinking about the technological frontiers that await us.
