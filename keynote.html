                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>The automotive industry is undergoing a profound transformation with the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs). These next-generation vehicles, driven by advanced software technologies, are poised to revolutionize mobility, safety, and user experience and create a new revenue engine for the automotive industry. At the heart of this evolution lies the critical role of real-time computing systems. This keynote will explore the intersection of SDVs and real-time technologies, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that await the real-time community.</p>
                    <p>First, I will define what an SDV is and present the significant industrial value it creates. Then, I will explain the four background factors that have led to the rapid rise of SDVs in recent times. Through this examination, we will recognize that SDVs are simultaneously cloud-native computing systems and mixed-criticality systems. In turn, I will introduce the standardized centralized zonal hardware architecture and the software platform operating on top of it, which are essential for realizing SDVs with these characteristics. It is important to note that the runtime system of an SDV must simultaneously satisfy the dynamic extendibility of applications and the static assurance of mixed-criticality services, which are somewhat contradictory requirements. The automotive industry has made significant efforts to meet these requirements but has been hindered by various technical challenges.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 40 years, the real-time computing community has built a profound academic foundation and made numerous innovations. With this knowledge, the real-time computing community has many opportunities to assist the automotive industry in its pursuit of SDV realization and lead the way toward the future of mobility. Based on this recognition, as a member of the real-time computing community, I will propose ways in which we can contribute to the realization of SDVs with a sense of mission. Join us as we navigate the road ahead, where real-time systems play a pivotal role in shaping the future of mobility through software-defined vehicles.</p>

                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Seongsoo Hong has been a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University for 30 years. He received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Engineering from Seoul National University and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, USA, with a focus on real-time systems design. Over the past 35 years, he has actively conducted academic research into real-time operating systems, middleware, design methodologies for real-time and embedded systems, with a focus on their application to mobile systems, telecommunication systems, and automotive systems. He is one of the founding members of IEEE RTCSA and a fellow of the National Academy of Engineering of Korea.</p>
                    <p>Professor Hong's work extends beyond academic research. He has served as a technology advisor to Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics Wireless Division, Samsung Semiconductor, Hyundai Autonet, and Hyundai Transys. He has also been an outside director for companies such as Hanwha Systems, LS Automotive, and Mercury System. As a result of these activities, he successfully industrialized the real-time operating system (RTOS) developed in his laboratory, contributing to the development of Velos, Neos, and SMK used in defense equipment such as KAI's advanced trainer aircraft and Samsung Electronics' product lines.</p>
                    <p>Professor Hong's recent research focuses on the design of mission-critical systems with real-time capabilities. A prime example is the software-defined vehicle (SDV), which has garnered significant attention as the core of future automobiles in the automotive industry. Over the past five years, Professor Hong has devoted efforts to concretizing the concept of SDV, raising public awareness, and presenting software engineering technologies necessary for SDV to evolve into an industrial reality. Currently, he is researching a MCS architecture framework with probabilistic guarantees, an essential technology in SDVs that ensures functional safety and mixed-criticality.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his academic and industrial activities, Professor Hong has been continuously engaged in community service. He served as the director of the Future Innovation Program (FIP) at Seoul National University, a continuing education program for entrepreneurs and policymakers. Currently, he is a board member of the Korea Polytechnics, an institution dedicated to nurturing future engineering talents. Furthermore, he has contributed to the development of the Korean Society of Automotive Engineers by establishing the Automotive Semiconductor and System S/W Division, where he serves as the inaugural chairman.</p>
