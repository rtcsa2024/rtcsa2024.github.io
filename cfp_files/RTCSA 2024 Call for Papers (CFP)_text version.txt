The RTCSA conference (now in its 30th edition) serves as a pivotal platform for experts from both academia and industry, fostering advancements in technology and theory for time-sensitive applications. The conference’s scope encompasses all applications where temporal aspects need to be considered. CPS, (Industrial) IoT, embedded systems, fog/edge/cloud computing are just notable examples. RTCSA is especially open to new and emerging topics. Such topics may include the application of machine learning in designing and analyzing embedded and real-time systems, strategies for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, etc. RTCSA welcomes both research and industrial papers that describe research or technical aspects in the area of embedded and real-time systems.  
Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work in person. RTCSA 2024 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.
