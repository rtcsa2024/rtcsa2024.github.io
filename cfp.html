            <p>The RTCSA conference (now in its 30th edition) serves as a pivotal platform for experts from both academia and industry, fostering advancements in <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>theory</strong> for <strong>time-sensitive</strong> applications. The conferenceâ€™s scope encompasses all applications where temporal aspects need to be considered. <strong>CPS, (Industrial) IoT, embedded systems, fog/edge/cloud computing</strong> are just notable examples. RTCSA is especially open to new and emerging topics. Such topics may include the application of machine learning in designing and analyzing embedded and real-time systems, strategies for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, etc. RTCSA welcomes both research and industrial papers that describe research or technical aspects in the area of embedded and real-time systems.</p>
            <p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work in person. RTCSA 2024 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>

            <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe <strong>original</strong> work <strong>not previously published</strong> and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. <strong>Abstract submission is a prerequisite for full paper submission.</strong> We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two formats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 10 pages</li>
                <li><strong>Short Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 6 pages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both types of submission must be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference proceedings format</a> (two-columns, single-space, 10pt) and <strong>must include references and acknowledgments within the page limit.</strong></p>
            <p>In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version. Conference content will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/">DBLP</a>.</p>
            <p>By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will register at full registration rate to the conference and present the paper in person.</p>
